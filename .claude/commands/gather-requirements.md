---

Use the requirements-elicitation subagent to gather requirements through stakeholder persona simulation.

Project context: $ARGUMENTS

The subagent should:
1. Ask high-level questions about the project purpose
2. Simulate different stakeholder personas (Product Owner, Risk Management, End User)
3. Extract implicit needs and requirements
4. Document findings in structured Markdown format

Output the requirements analysis to a file for further processing.
