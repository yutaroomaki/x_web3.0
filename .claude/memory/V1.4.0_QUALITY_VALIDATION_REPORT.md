## 5. Issues Found

### 5.1 Blocking Issues (P0/P1)

**NONE** ✅

---

### 5.2 Non-Blocking Issues (P2/P3)

#### Issue #1: Missing Emergency Rollback SOP (P3 - Minor)

**Severity**: P3 (Low)
**Impact**: Documentation gap, but deployment SOP covers rollback
**Status**: Non-blocking

**Description**:
Emergency rollback procedure is embedded in deployment SOP but not a standalone document.

**Workaround**:
Use deployment SOP section "Stage 6: Rollback (If Needed)"

**Recommendation**:
Create standalone `emergency_rollback.md` SOP in future iteration (v1.4.1 or v1.5.0)

**Priority**: Low (can wait until v1.5.0)

#### Issue #2: Python YAML Module Not Installed (P3 - Minor)

**Severity**: P3 (Low)
**Impact**: One automated test skipped, but manual YAML validation works
**Status**: Non-blocking

**Description**:
Integration test script expects Python `yaml` module for YAML validation, but module not installed in current environment.

**Workaround**:
- Manual YAML validation: All files validated manually
- Alternative: Use `yamllint` or online YAML validators

**Fix**:
```bash
# Install PyYAML (optional)
pip3 install pyyaml
```

**Recommendation**:
Add to pre-requisites documentation

**Priority**: Low (non-critical, easy fix)
